<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>This is a modern portfolio website for online marketing specialist. Developed with focus on performance, responsive design and clean, futuristic design.</p>
<p>The project of this type was a perfect excuse for me to pick up Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, as I haven't worked with these technologies before. Next.js naturally felt a good fit because the app is frontend heavy, but there was still a need to handle some backend requests as well.</p>
<p>My job was to create graphic design for the website, prepare color palette, build the whole application and deploy it.</p>
